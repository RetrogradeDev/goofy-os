- **Window Manager**: Multi-window support with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Taskbar & Start Menu**: Familiar desktop experience with application launcher
- **Multiple Applications**:
  - **Calculator**: Full-featured calculator with arithmetic operations
  - **Notepad**: Text editor with cursor support and scrolling
  - **System Information**: Real-time system monitoring and statistics

### **Core System Features**
- **Memory Management**:
  - Custom heap allocator with allocation tracking
  - Virtual memory with paging support
  - Frame allocation and memory mapping
  - Memory protection and isolation

- **Interrupt Handling**:
  - Complete Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) implementation
  - Hardware interrupt support (keyboard, mouse, timer)
  - Interrupt-driven I/O for responsive user interaction

- **Input/Output Systems**:
  - PS/2 keyboard support with full key mapping
  - PS/2 mouse support with click detection and movement
  - Serial port debugging and logging
  - Framebuffer graphics with custom font rendering

- **Processes and custom ELF loading**:
  - Loads and maps ELF binaries into memory
  - Supports user-space processes with isolated memory
  - Context switching and scheduling
  - System calls for user applications

###### Note: processes are developed in the `processes_better` branch and can be extremely unstable.

### **Graphics & Rendering**
- **Custom Graphics Engine**:
  - Framebuffer-based rendering system
  - Shape primitives (rectangles, text, lines)
  - Surface composition and layering
  - Multiple font sizes and weights (Noto Sans Mono)
  - Color management and transparency support

- **Advanced Text Rendering**:
  - Anti-aliased font rendering
  - Multiple font weights (Light, Regular, Bold)
  - Scalable font sizes (Size16, Size20, Size24, Size28, Size32)
  - Text cursor support with positioning

### **System Architecture**
- **Global Descriptor Table (GDT)**: Proper x86_64 segmentation
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: UTC time tracking and second precision
- **Boot Support**: Both UEFI* and Legacy BIOS compatibility
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed for x86_64 architecture
- **No Standard Library**: Complete `#![no_std]` implementation

### **Development Features**
- **Debug Support**: Serial logging and QEMU integration
- **Panic Handling**: Graceful error handling and debugging information

### Boot Process
1. **Bootloader**: UEFI*/BIOS bootloader loads kernel
2. **Memory Setup**: Physical memory mapping and heap initialization
3. **System Initialization**: GDT, IDT, and interrupt setup
4. **Hardware Detection**: Framebuffer and input device initialization
5. **Desktop Launch**: GUI environment with window manager

###### * UEFI Support is a WIP

## Getting Started
